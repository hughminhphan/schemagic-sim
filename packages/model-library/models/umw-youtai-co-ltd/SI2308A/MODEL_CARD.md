## Fitted versus datasheet

| Quantity | Datasheet | Fitted | Unit | Relative error | Citation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| No F2 residual claim | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | See cited package expectations |

F1 parameters are transcribed or derived from cited headline targets; no multi-point F2 residual claim is made.

Native and WASM agreement: all 1 benches passed. Worst reported relative delta was 1.671e-16 and worst absolute delta was 2.776e-17.

## Known omissions

- AC, transient, noise, thermal, and package-parasitic behavior are outside this DC-only conveyor package.
- Temperature dependence and self-heating are not modelled; the electrical region is limited to the cited nominal-temperature data.
- Catalog parametrics were used only as initial guesses or F1 fallback constraints and are not datasheet citations.
- F2 evidence did not qualify; staged as F1: family parked after 2 consecutive F2 fit-gate failures with no F2 success; later parts staged F1 (mosfet extraction cannot support an F2 fit: no usable 25 degC transfer curve (drain current versus gate-source voltage))
- Gate-threshold behavior is not covered by this F1 package; the supported region is limited to cited nominal-temperature RDS(on) targets.
