## Fitted versus datasheet

| Quantity | Datasheet | Fitted | Unit | Relative error | Citation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| No F2 residual claim | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | See cited package expectations |

F1 parameters are transcribed or derived from cited headline targets; no multi-point F2 residual claim is made.

Native and WASM agreement: all 4 benches passed. Worst reported relative delta was 1.305e-11 and worst absolute delta was 9.149e-12.

## Known omissions

- AC, transient, noise, thermal, and package-parasitic behavior are outside this DC-only conveyor package.
- Temperature dependence and self-heating are not modelled; the electrical region is limited to the cited nominal-temperature data.
- Catalog parametrics were used only as initial guesses or F1 fallback constraints and are not datasheet citations.
- F2 evidence did not qualify; staged as F1: No defensible numeric curve points could be extracted from the supplied PDF plots without inventing or interpolating data.
- No defensible numeric curve points could be extracted from the supplied PDF plots without inventing or interpolating data.

- F1 gain support is limited to the cited 25 degC hFE table point at IC = 5 mA and |VCE| = 10 V.
