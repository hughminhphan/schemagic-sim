## Fitted versus datasheet

| Quantity | Datasheet | Fitted | Unit | Relative error | Citation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| No F2 residual claim | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | See cited package expectations |

F1 parameters are transcribed or derived from cited headline targets; no multi-point F2 residual claim is made.

Native and WASM agreement: all 3 benches passed. Worst reported relative delta was 3.045e-10 and worst absolute delta was 2.006e-10.

## Known omissions

- AC, transient, noise, thermal, and package-parasitic behavior are outside this DC-only conveyor package.
- Temperature dependence and self-heating are not modelled; the electrical region is limited to the cited nominal-temperature data.
- Catalog parametrics were used only as initial guesses or F1 fallback constraints and are not datasheet citations.
- F2 evidence did not qualify; staged as F1: Validation failed for PBSS4160T-215. See validation-results.json; failed package checks: vce_sat_1 observed 0.14518457708368532 (allowed error 0.02), vce_sat_2 observed 0.15548837509197755 (allowed error 0.022000000000000002), vce_sat_3 observed 0.24175636195842717 (allowed error 0.04000000000000001)
- No input capacitance Cibo is published, and the only VBEsat row does not share the IC/IB pair of any VCEsat row required by the paired saturation schema.
- Saturation-voltage behavior is not covered by this F1 package; the supported region is limited to cited DC current-gain evidence.
