| noise | none |
| thermal | none |
| digital | none |

## Model parameters

| Parameter | Value | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| IS | 6.01915576e-11 | derived from cited maximum bound |
| N | 1.80000000e+0 | declared fixed F1 policy constant |
| RS | 1.00000000e-4 | declared fixed F1 policy constant |
| BV | 1.18000000e+1 | fitted or derived |
| IBV | 5.00000000e-3 | fitted or derived |
| NBV | 1.00000000e+0 | fitted or derived |

## Fitted versus datasheet

| Quantity | Datasheet | Fitted | Unit | Relative error | Citation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| No F2 residual claim | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | See cited package expectations |

F1 parameters are transcribed or derived from cited headline targets; no multi-point F2 residual claim is made.

Native and WASM agreement: all 1 benches passed. Worst reported relative delta was 9.500e-12 and worst absolute delta was 8.391e-12.

## Known omissions

- AC, transient, noise, thermal, and package-parasitic behavior are outside this DC-only conveyor package.
- Temperature dependence and self-heating are not modelled; each electrical claim is limited to its exact cited bench temperature.
- Catalog parametrics may be recorded only as optimizer seeds; they are not evidence, constraints, residual targets, or datasheet citations.
- No usable target-specific curve was extracted; the datasheet provides no reverse-recovery-time specification.
- Reverse-bias leakage is not covered by this F1 package because the approximation is supported only over cited forward-bias targets.
