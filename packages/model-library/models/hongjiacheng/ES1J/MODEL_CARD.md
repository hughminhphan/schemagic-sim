## Domain coverage

| Domain | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| dc | approx |
| ac | none |
| transient | none |
| noise | none |
| thermal | none |
| digital | none |

## Model parameters

| Parameter | Value | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| IS | 3.11266664e-16 | fitted or derived |
| N | 1.80000000e+0 | fitted or derived |
| RS | 1.00000000e-4 | fitted or derived |

## Fitted versus datasheet

| Quantity | Datasheet | Fitted | Unit | Relative error | Citation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| No F2 residual claim | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | See cited package expectations |

F1 parameters are transcribed or derived from cited headline targets; no multi-point F2 residual claim is made.

Native and WASM agreement: all 1 benches passed. Worst reported relative delta was 1.742e-14 and worst absolute delta was 2.887e-14.

## Known omissions

- AC, transient, noise, thermal, and package-parasitic behavior are outside this DC-only conveyor package.
- Temperature dependence and self-heating are not modelled; the electrical region is limited to the cited nominal-temperature data.
- Catalog parametrics were used only as initial guesses or F1 fallback constraints and are not datasheet citations.
- F2 evidence did not qualify; staged as F1: diode extraction cannot support an F2 fit: forward I-V curve 'Typical forward voltage, ES1H-ES1M curve' has 3 usable points after validation; 4 required
- Reverse-bias leakage is not covered by this F1 package because the approximation is supported only over cited forward-bias targets.
