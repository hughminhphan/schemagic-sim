## Model parameters

| Parameter | Value | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| IS | 1.34145237e-7 | fitted or derived |
| N | 1.10000000e+0 | fitted or derived |
| RS | 1.00000000e-4 | fitted or derived |

## Fitted versus datasheet

| Quantity | Datasheet | Fitted | Unit | Relative error | Citation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| No F2 residual claim | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | See cited package expectations |

F1 parameters are transcribed or derived from cited headline targets; no multi-point F2 residual claim is made.

Native and WASM agreement: all 1 benches passed. Worst reported relative delta was 1.419e-14 and worst absolute delta was 6.883e-15.

## Known omissions

- AC, transient, noise, thermal, and package-parasitic behavior are outside this DC-only conveyor package.
- Temperature dependence and self-heating are not modelled; the electrical region is limited to the cited nominal-temperature data.
- Catalog parametrics were used only as initial guesses or F1 fallback constraints and are not datasheet citations.
- F2 evidence did not qualify; staged as F1: family parked after 2 consecutive F2 fit-gate failures with no F2 success; later parts staged F1 (diode F2 gate failed: forward_voltage worst relative error 0.0538 exceeds gate 0.05)
- Reverse-bias leakage is not covered by this F1 package because the approximation is supported only over cited forward-bias targets.
