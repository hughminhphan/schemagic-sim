## Fitted versus datasheet

| Quantity | Datasheet | Fitted | Unit | Relative error | Citation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| No F2 residual claim | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | See cited package expectations |

F1 parameters are transcribed or derived from cited headline targets; no multi-point F2 residual claim is made.

Native and WASM agreement: all 3 benches passed. Worst reported relative delta was 5.697e-12 and worst absolute delta was 4.436e-13.

## Known omissions

- AC, transient, noise, thermal, and package-parasitic behavior are outside this DC-only conveyor package.
- Temperature dependence and self-heating are not modelled; the electrical region is limited to the cited nominal-temperature data.
- Catalog parametrics were used only as initial guesses or F1 fallback constraints and are not datasheet citations.
- F2 evidence did not qualify; staged as F1: Validation failed for MMBT4401. See validation-results.json; failed package checks: vbe_sat_1_maximum observed 0.9606771214182486 (maximum 0.95), vbe_sat_2_maximum observed 1.2986552780269451 (maximum 1.2)
- Saturation-voltage behavior is not covered by this F1 package; the supported region is limited to cited DC current-gain evidence.
