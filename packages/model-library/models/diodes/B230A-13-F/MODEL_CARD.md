## Domain coverage

| Domain | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| dc | approx |
| ac | none |
| transient | none |
| noise | none |
| thermal | none |
| digital | none |

## Model parameters

| Parameter | Value | Status |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| IS | 4.16386261e-6 | fitted or derived |
| N | 1.10000000e+0 | fitted or derived |
| RS | 1.00000000e-4 | fitted or derived |

## Fitted versus datasheet

| Quantity | Datasheet | Fitted | Unit | Relative error | Citation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| No F2 residual claim | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | See cited package expectations |

F1 parameters are transcribed or derived from cited headline targets; no multi-point F2 residual claim is made.

Native and WASM agreement: all 2 benches passed. Worst reported relative delta was 7.542e-13 and worst absolute delta was 1.719e-13.

## Known omissions

- AC, transient, noise, thermal, and package-parasitic behavior are outside this DC-only conveyor package.
- Temperature dependence and self-heating are not modelled; each electrical claim is limited to its exact cited bench temperature.
- Catalog parametrics may be recorded only as optimizer seeds; they are not evidence, constraints, residual targets, or datasheet citations.
- Reverse-bias leakage is not covered by this F1 package because the approximation is supported only over cited forward-bias targets.
