## Fitted versus datasheet

| Quantity | Datasheet | Fitted | Unit | Relative error | Citation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| No F2 residual claim | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | See cited package expectations |

F1 parameters are transcribed or derived from cited headline targets; no multi-point F2 residual claim is made.

Native and WASM agreement: all 1 benches passed. Worst reported relative delta was 0.000e+00 and worst absolute delta was 0.000e+00.

## Known omissions

- AC, transient, noise, thermal, and package-parasitic behavior are outside this DC-only conveyor package.
- Temperature dependence and self-heating are not modelled; the electrical region is limited to the cited nominal-temperature data.
- Catalog parametrics were used only as initial guesses or F1 fallback constraints and are not datasheet citations.
- F2 evidence did not qualify; staged as F1: mosfet F2 gate failed: drain_current worst relative error 0.8018 exceeds gate 0.2; drain_current RMS relative error 0.2522 exceeds gate 0.12
- Gate-threshold behavior is not covered by this F1 package; the supported region is limited to cited nominal-temperature RDS(on) targets.
